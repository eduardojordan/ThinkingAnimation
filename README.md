<h1 style="font-size: 40px;">🎬 ThinkingAnimation</h1>

ThinkingAnimation is a simple practice project built with SwiftUI to explore the behavior and integration of animations. This project demonstrates how to implement basic animations and transitions in SwiftUI. The goal is to understand the interactions of different animation types and how they can be applied to a potential project. No architecture or refactoring is considered in this project, as it's just a simple experiment.

<h2 style="font-size: 35px;">🚀 Features</h2>

✅ Basic SwiftUI animations (e.g., scale, rotation, opacity)  
✅ Use of animation triggers such as button taps  
✅ Simple transitions between views  
✅ Exploration of implicit and explicit animations

<h2 style="font-size: 35px;">🏗 Architecture</h2>

This project follows a straightforward SwiftUI-based approach without a specific architecture. The main focus is on exploring animations, using a minimal setup to demonstrate different types of animations and transitions.
